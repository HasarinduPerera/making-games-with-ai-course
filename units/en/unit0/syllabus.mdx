## The Recommended Pace

Each unit in this course is designed to be completed **in 1 week**, with approximately 3-4 hours of work per week. 

We defined a recommended pace that you can follow.

However, you can take as much time as necessary to complete the course. If you want to dive into a topic more in-depth, we’ll provide additional resources to help you achieve that.

For the demo you need to make, we recommend to work from two weeks to one month maximum.
