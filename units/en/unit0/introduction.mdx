Welcome to the course that will teach you the most fascinating topic in game development: **how to use powerful AI tools and models to create amazing game experiences**.

[ADD INFOS AND DEMO ABOUT OPPORTUNITY]

New AI models are revolutionizing the Game Industry in two impactful ways:

- How we make games:
    - Generate textures using AI
    - Using AI voice actor for the voices.
    - 

- How we make gameplay:
    - Crafting intelligent Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) using large language models.
   
This course will teach you both:

- Learn how to **integrate AI models for innovative gameplay**, featuring intelligent NPCs.
- How to use AI tools to help your game development

## Your Goal during this course: Crafting Your Own Game Demo

During this course, youâ€™re going to work with some provided demo we made. 

But the most exciting part, is that during the whole course **youâ€™re also going to work on your own demo**. 

You'll build a game demo using either:

- **AI tools to help you build the game** (for instance texture generation, AI voice actors...)
- Using a AI in the game as gameplay or for the NPC.
