Welcome to the course that will teach you the most fascinating topic in game development: **how to use powerful AI tools and models to create amazing game experiences**.


New AI models are revolutionizing the Game Industry in two impactful ways:

- On how we make games:
    - Generate textures using AI
    - Using AI voice actor for the voices.


- How we make gameplay:
    - Crafting intelligent Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) using large language models.
