# Your Game Demo

The main goal of this course is to **learn how to use these new powerful AI models** either during the game creation or in the game for innovative gameplay.

And the best way to learn it is **by doing**. That's why we decided that to get your certificate of completion (it's free) you need to provide a demo you built in group or alone.

Indeed, at the end of the course you'll **have your own game demo using AI**.

## The Game Demo ðŸŽ®

Here are the **criterion for validating the game demo**:

- Have a team from 1 to 5 teammates.
- Have a working demo that can run either on WEBGL or Windows.
- The Demo and application must be in **English**.
- The game must use **at least one open-source tool is part of the game or workflow**.

If you don't have ideas yet, don't worry, we wrote some units called "Demo Units" that will help you define your game demo and avoid common pitfalls (too big scope etc).

## How do I choose which Game Engine to use?

Itâ€™s up to you. For now, **we advise you to use Unity** since we produced most of the content for this v1 of the course with their tools. 

In general, we strongly advise you to choose a game engine and not develop a game from scratch with only code. Because the scope of making a demo in one month is already a big step, adding complexity is not a good idea.


## But... I don't know how to make games!

Donâ€™t worry, that's the perfect time to start! If you want to start making games with Unity, check this amazing course: Create with Code. Where you'll learn to make 5 different games.

With this create with code free course, you'll get everything you need to be able to follow Making Games with AI Course.

## The Certification Process

You can get a free certificate of completion at the end of the course. We'll explain later in the course how to get it ðŸ¤—.


## What tools do I need?

The minimum tools you need are:

- *A computer* with an internet connection.
- A *Hugging Face Account*: (itâ€™s free), you will need one to be able to use AI models and publish your game demos.
- A Game Engine Licence: (free version is enough for most of the cases), naturally you can create your game from scratch. But we advise you to use a Game Engine. Either Unity or Unreal.
