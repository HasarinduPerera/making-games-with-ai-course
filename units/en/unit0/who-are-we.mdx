My name is Thomas Simonini, I'm a **Game Developer working at Hugging Face** ðŸ¤— focused on how to **integrate AI models in games to create new experiences** ðŸª„ .

In addition to this course, I'm writing in my blog [AI Playbook for Game Developers ðŸŽ®](https://thomassimonini.substack.com/) where I explore the intersection of AI and game development with tutorials and demos showcasing the integration of Machine Learning and AI models into video games. ðŸŽ® From Smart NPC with Large Language Models to Generative AI. And making video tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThomasSimonini?sub_confirmation=1).
