What we do in this unit?:

- First game you make? Watch these demos
- Find your ideas + demos Game Jam
- Write the GDD
- Keep the scope small
- Share the idea





# Let's define your Game Demo

Welcome to this Unit, where we're going to find your game idea and write your Game Design Document ðŸ¤©.

This course has 3 types of Units:
- *Course Unit*: where you learn a concept and you apply it with a hands-on.
- *Demo Unit*: where you define and create your own demo
- *Bonus Unit*: where you can learn advanced concepts such as classical AI in games or ML for 3D.

This Unit is a Demo Unit.

As we explained in the first Unit, the goal at the end of this course, is that you built a demo using either:
- AI tools to help you build the game (for instance texture generation, AI voice actors...)
- Using a AI in the game as gameplay or for an NPC.


## Should I work alone or with a team?

You can do your demo alone, but we strongly advise you to join a team. This way you **can build a better demo if multiple people with different skills participate** and it's funnier.

To find a team, check [NAME OF THE CHANNEL], you can either pitch an idea if you already have one. Or join a team.






So, in this first Demo Unit, you're going to find your game idea and write your Game Design Document. 

This one page document will help you define:
- The gameplay of your game
- The story (if any)
- Which AI model you're going to use
- What assets you're going to need
- The scope
- The team (if any)


Again, I'll repeat during the whole course, but **keep your scope small**, the goal at the end of this course is to get a working demo that you can share and iterate on it after. But to be able to do that, you need to keep your scope small.

For this section, we curated the best resources you can find online.

So let's get started

















## Step 2: Defining our GDD

In this second step, we're going to
