# Let's define your Game idea ðŸ’¡

[ADD Illustration thumbnail]

Welcome to this exciting Unit, **where you'll define and polish your game idea and write your Game Design Document ðŸ¤©**.

As we explained during the introduction Unit, the goal at the end of this course is that **you'll build a game demo using either**:

- **AI tools to help you build the game** (texture generation, AI voice actors...)
- Using **AI in the game as gameplay or for the NPC**.

This course has three types of Units:
- *Course Unit*: learn a concept and apply it with a hands-on.
- *Demo Unit*: define and work on your demo.
- *Bonus Unit*: dive into advanced concepts such as classical AI in games or ML for 3D.

This Unit is a Demo Unit.

So, in this first Demo Unit, you will define your game idea and write your Game Design Document (GDD). 

This GDD, a one-page document, will help you define the following:
- Gameplay mechanics
- The story (if any)
- Which AI model/tools you're going to use
- What assets you're going to need
- The scope
- The team (if any)


During the course, we'll emphasize the importance of **keeping your scope small** to be able to finish your demo.

For this section, we curated the best resources you can find online.


## Solo or Team Effort?

While creating your demo independently is possible, we strongly recommend joining a team. 

To find a team, check [NAME OF THE CHANNEL]. You can pitch an idea if you already have one. Or join a team.

So let's get started!

You'll iterate during this course with this GDD
