# Let's build your Game Demo

[ADD Illustration thumbnail]

Welcome to this exciting unit, where you'll shape your game idea and write your Game Design Document ðŸ¤©.

As we explained during the first unit, the goal at the end of this course, is that you'll built a game demo using either:

- **AI tools to help you build the game** (for instance texture generation, AI voice actors...)
- Using a AI in the game as gameplay or for the NPC.

And this course has 3 types of Units:
- *Course Unit*: learn a concept and you apply it with a hands-on.
- *Demo Unit*: define and work on your demo.
- *Bonus Unit*: dive into advanced concepts such as classical AI in games or ML for 3D.

This Unit is a Demo Unit.

So, in this first Demo Unit, you're going to discover your game idea and write your Game Design Document (GDD). 

This GDD, a one page document will help you define:
- Gameplay mechanics
- The story (if any)
- Which AI model/tools you're going to use
- What assets you're going to need
- The scope
- The team (if any)


During the course we'll emphasize the importance of **keeping your scope small** to be able to finish your demo.

For this section, we curated the best resources you can find online.


## Solo or Team Effort?

While it's possible to create your demo independently, we strongly recommend joining a team. 

To find a team, check [NAME OF THE CHANNEL], you can either pitch an idea if you already have one. Or join a team.

So let's get started!
