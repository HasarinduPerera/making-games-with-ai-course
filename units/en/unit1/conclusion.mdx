# Conclusion

Congratulations on finishing this first unit! **With a few steps weâ€™ve just built a robot thatâ€™s able to perform actions based on your orders thatâ€™s amazing!**

What you can do next is dive deeper into the code in Scripts/Final and look at the final scene in Scenes/Final. I commented on every part of it so it should be relatively straightforward.

In the next Unit, we're going to **help you define and polish your game idea and write your Game Design Document ðŸ¤©**.

Keep Learning, Stay Awesome ðŸ¤—
