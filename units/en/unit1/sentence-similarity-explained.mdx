# The power of Sentence Similarity ü§ñ

Before diving into making the demo, we must **understand sentence similarity and how it works**.

## How does this game work?

In this game, we want to **give more freedom to the player**: instead of giving an order to a robot by just clicking a button, we want him to interact with it through text.

The robot has a list of actions and **uses a sentence similarity model that selects the closest action** (if any) given the player‚Äôs order.

For instance, if I write, ‚ÄúHey, grab me the red box‚Äù, **the robot isn‚Äôt programmed to know what ‚ÄúHey, grab me the red box‚Äù is**. But the sentence similarity model connected this order and the ‚Äúbring me red cube‚Äù action.

Therefore, thanks to this technique, **we can build believable character AI without having the tedious process of mapping every possible player input interaction to robot response by hand**. By letting the sentence similarity model do the job.

## What is Sentence Similarity?

Sentence Similarity is a task able, given a source sentence and sentences, **to calculate how similar sentences are to the source sentence**.

For instance, if our source sentence (player order) is ‚ÄúHey grab me the red box‚Äù it‚Äôs very close to the ‚ÄúBring red box‚Äù sentence.

Sentence similarity models convert input text ‚ÄúHello‚Äù into vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic information. We call this step to embed. Then, we calculate how close (similar) they are using **cosine similarity**.

I‚Äôll not go into the details, but since our sentence similarity models produce vectors. We can calculate **the cosine of the angle between two vectors. The closer the result is to 1, the more similar these two vectors are.**

## The Complete pipeline

Now that we understand Sentence Similarity **let's see the entire pipeline: from how a player inputs an order to the robot acting**.

1. The player types an order: "Can you bring me the red cube?"

2. The robot has a list of actions ["Hello", "Happy", "Bring the red cube", "Move to the red cube"]

3. What we want to do then is to embed this player input text **to compare to the robot action list to find the most similar action (if any).**

4. To do that **we tokenize the input**: a Transformer model can't take a string as input. **It needs to be translated into numbers.** This is done using the Tokenizer code provided by [Sharp Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/sharp-transformers).

5. Then, the input (tokenized) is passed to the model **that outputs an embedding of this text**: a vector that captures semantic information about the text. This inference part is done by Unity Sentis.

6. Now we can compare **this vector with other vectors (from the action list) using cosine similarity.**

7. We select the action with the **highest similarity and get the similarity score.**

If the similarity score > 0.2, **we ask the robot to perform the action.**

Otherwise, we ask the robot to perform "I'm perplexed" animation. Since the order given **is too different from the action list** (it can be the case if the player for instance writes something totally irrelevant like "do you like rabbits?".

Now that we understood, the whole pipeline. You might wondering how to run this AI model? In the player's machine or remotely? And what are the differences. That's the topic of the next section.
