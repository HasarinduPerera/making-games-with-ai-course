# How to run an AI model: local vs remote

In this game, we want to run a sentence similarity model, I'm going to use [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

It's a BERT Transformer model. It's **already trained so we can use it directly.**

But here, I have two solutions to run it, I can:

- *Run this AI model remotely*: **on a server**. And I send API calls and get responses from the server. That requires an internet connection.
- *Run this AI model locally*: **on the player machine.**

Both are valid solutions, **but they have advantages and inconvenients**.


## Running the model remotely

I run the model **on a remote server**, and send API calls to the game. Or use an API service to do it directly for me.

For instance, Hugging Face provides a free API called [Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api) that allows you use AI models via simple API calls. And we have a [Unity plugin](https://huggingface.co/blog/unity-api) to access and use Hugging Face AI models within their Unity projects.


## Advantages

- You're not using the RAM/VRAM of your player.
- You can access the data, and understand what actions the players usually type to improve your NPC. 

## Inconvenients

- **Dependence on an internet connection**, risking immersion disruption due to potential API lag.
- **Potential high cost associated with API usage**, especially with many players.


Usually, you use an API if you use a very big model that couldn't run on a player machine. For instance if you use Llama-2 big models.



## Running the model locally

I run the model locally: on the player machine. To be able to do that I use two libraries.

1. [Unity Sentis](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.sentis@latest): the neural network inference library that allow us to run our AI model directly inside our game.

2. [The Hugging Face Sharp Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/sharp-transformers): a Unity plugin of utilities to run Transformer ðŸ¤— models in Unity games.

### Advantages

- You don't have usage cost since everything runs on your player machine.
- The player does not need to be connected to the Internet.


### Inconvenients

- You use the RAM/VRAM of the player so you need to specify spec recommendations 
- You can't know the model usage and what people ask.



Since the sentence similarity model we're going to use is small, **we decided to run it locally**.
